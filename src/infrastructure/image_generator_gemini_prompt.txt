Read the novel text and craft a highly captivating and emotionally resonant image prompt. The goal is to generate an image that is attractive and deeply engaging, drawing the viewer into the scene's narrative.
The image should capture an artistic and atmospheric interpretation of the scene, with a Japanese aesthetic.
Include general stylistic elements such as: (Japanese aesthetic), (soft natural lighting), (clean composition), (film photography), (artistic interpretation).
Then, extract specific elements from the text, focusing on:
- The specific mood and emotional tone of the scene (e.g., serene, vibrant, melancholic).
- Key objects, locations, and actions.
- Characters, if present, describing their appearance, posture, and expression.
- Specific lighting conditions or colors mentioned in the text.

Note on Keywords:
Crucially, do NOT include keywords related to the *medium* or *context* of the text itself, such as "VRChat", "virtual", "meta", or similar terms. The goal is to visualize the narrative, not the platform it describes.
