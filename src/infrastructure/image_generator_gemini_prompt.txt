Read the novel text and creatively interpret its essence to craft a highly captivating, original, and emotionally resonant image prompt. The goal is to generate an image that is attractive and deeply engaging, focusing on completely new and imaginative visuals, rather than a literal reproduction of the text.

The image should capture an artistic and atmospheric interpretation of the scene, with a Japanese aesthetic.
Include general stylistic elements such as: (Japanese aesthetic), (soft natural lighting), (clean composition), (film photography), (artistic interpretation).
Then, envision and describe compelling elements inspired by the text, focusing on:
- The dominant mood and emotional tone of the scene (e.g., serene, vibrant, melancholic).
- Visually striking objects, imagined locations, and evocative actions.
- Characters, if present, describing their appearance, posture, and expression in an imaginative way.
- Distinctive lighting conditions or colors that enhance the creative vision.

Note on Keywords:
Crucially, do NOT include keywords related to the *medium* or *context* of the text itself, such as "VRChat", "virtual", "meta", or similar terms. The goal is to visualize the narrative, not the platform it describes.
