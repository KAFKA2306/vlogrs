Read the novel text and creatively interpret its essence to craft a highly captivating, original, and emotionally resonant image prompt. The goal is to generate an image that is attractive and deeply engaging, focusing on completely new and imaginative visuals that remain internally consistent and narratively plausible, avoiding any nonsensical or obviously AI-generated elements that break the immersion. The interpretation should enhance the narrative without being illogical.

The image should capture a vivid and clear interpretation of the scene.
Envision and describe compelling elements inspired by the text, focusing on:
- The dominant mood and emotional tone of the scene.
- Visually striking objects, imagined locations, and evocative actions.
- Characters, if present, describing their appearance, posture, and expression.
- Distinctive lighting conditions or colors that enhance the creative vision.

Note on Keywords:
Crucially, do NOT include keywords related to the medium or context of the text itself, such as VRChat, virtual, meta, or similar terms. The goal is to visualize the narrative, not the platform it describes.
Also, be careful not to interpret metaphors, puns, or specific Japanese terms literally (e.g., "butakusa" (ragweed) should NOT be interpreted as "pig"). Focus on the actual visual scene described.
Do NOT use keywords like "translucent", "transparent", "semi-transparent", or "ethereal" for characters or main objects. Subjects must be solid and opaque.
Do NOT include "pig", "swine", or similar animals in the image prompt, even if they are mentioned in the text.
